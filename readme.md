# Spring ORM Practice

**Project** : hibernate

This project is a basic demonstration of setting up Hibernate for Spring applications to perform object-relational mapping (ORM).

**Practiced Concepts:**

1. **Hibernate Configuration:** Configured Hibernate through `hibernate.cfg.xml`, specifying database connection details, dialect, and other properties.

2. **Persistence Annotations:** Utilized Hibernate's persistence annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, and `@Column` to map Java entities to corresponding database tables and columns.

3. **Fetch Types:** Explored different fetch types to control how related entities are loaded from the database.

4. **Cascading:** Learned about cascading operations to automatically propagate changes from parent entities to associated child entities.

5. **Caching:** Explored caching mechanisms in Hibernate to improve application performance by reducing the number of database queries.

6. **Session Management:** Managed Hibernate `SessionFactory` using a utility class (`HibernateUtil`) to establish and close database sessions efficiently.

7. **Transaction Handling:** Implemented transaction management using `Transaction` objects to ensure data consistency and integrity during database operations.

8. **Persisting Data:** Practiced persisting data to the database using Hibernate's session API.

Through this project, I've gained practical experience in setting up Hibernate within a Spring application, defining entity mappings, managing sessions and transactions, and persisting data to the database efficiently. These skills are essential for building robust and scalable Spring applications that interact with relational databases using ORM frameworks like Hibernate.
